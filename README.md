# Notes — Minimal Blog

A text-focused publication with topic filters, a narrow reading column, author-only drafts, an editor, and comments.

Built from new source for task 4. The interface uses a restrained palette, fine dividers, system fonts, native dialogs, and responsive layouts. Each project is self-contained.

## Run locally

Requires Python 3.12. Run commands from this project directory:

```sh
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env
python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))"
```

Paste the generated value into `SECRET_KEY` in `.env`. Use a different value for each application. On Windows, activate with `.venv\Scripts\activate`.

```sh
flask --app app:create_app seed
python app.py
```

Open http://localhost:3200. `PORT` can override that port. SQLite creates a persistent local database in `instance/app.db`. Seed commands preserve existing records. No credentials or databases are bundled.

## Using the app

Anyone can read published posts. Register to write, keep private drafts, publish, edit or delete your own posts, and comment on published writing. Comment authors can delete their comments. Seed articles are sample writing attributed to an Editorial team account with no usable published login.

## Backend and database

Flask serves the HTML, static assets, and JSON API from one origin. SQLAlchemy stores the data. Passwords are hashed with Werkzeug; sessions use HTTP-only, SameSite cookies. Each application has a separate session cookie name. All state-changing API requests require the CSRF token returned by `GET /api/session` in an `X-CSRF-Token` header. Authentication responses rotate that token. User-entered content is rendered as text.

For PostgreSQL, set `DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host/database`. Tables are created at startup for a fresh installation. Existing production schemas require planned migrations when models change.

## Deploy

Use a Python web host with a durable PostgreSQL database. Set `SECRET_KEY`, `DATABASE_URL`, and `APP_ENV=production` in the host's environment. Install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`, then start with:

```sh
gunicorn wsgi:app --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT
```

Use HTTPS: production mode enables Secure cookies. Run the seed command once if sample content is wanted. A `Procfile` is included. Hosting and database provisioning are separate from the source project; no live deployment is claimed.

## Verify

```sh
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
python -m pytest -q
```

API coverage: Draft privacy, author ownership, publication, post updates/deletion, comment permissions, and authentication.

The browser flows were also exercised at 1440px and 390px, with no JavaScript errors or horizontal overflow. Screenshots are from those local checks. Automated database tests use SQLite; PostgreSQL concurrency has not been load-tested.

## Publish as a separate repository

Suggested repository: `Aryan-17159/task-4-minimal-blog`. From this directory, after signing into GitHub CLI with an account allowed to create repositories:

```sh
git init -b main
git add .
git commit -m "Build minimal journal application"
gh repo create Aryan-17159/task-4-minimal-blog --public --source=. --remote=origin --push
```

If this directory already has a Git history, skip the initialization and commit steps. Never commit `.env`, runtime databases, or credentials.
